1. Never launch OVR Toolkit through Oculus Home -This may launch the application incorrectly. 2. Please refer to the 'Oculus' page on our Wiki (by the button above) if OVR Toolkit doesn't appear in your games due to the game not running through OpenVR. 3. Please note that running games through OpenVR may reduce their performance as you will be rendering SteamVR and the Oculus compositor. This is unavoidable with any overlay application on Steam! Don't hesitate to join our Discord for help! :)

"The tutorial is now complete, we hope you enjoy your time using OVR Toolkit!"
There are upcoming events for this game!
These will appear on your wristwatch in VR
This fix will link your SteamVR Resolution to your overlay supersampling. (Up to 150 )
"This will set the default settings used on all newly spawned windows, are you sure?"
This workaround will trick SteamVR into thinking your PC is faster than it is so the overlay resolution will be increased.
Those are the basics of using OVR Toolkit! Find more info on our wiki or on our Discord!
